    }
}
```

Upwork stores the full data of the frelancer in a javascript variable. You can access that variable to get more information from the freelancer profile. The code bellow adds the full profile variable to the output. You can use the extended output function to extract only the data that you need.

```javascript
async () => {
    return { profileResponse: window.PROFILE_RESPONSE }
}
```
